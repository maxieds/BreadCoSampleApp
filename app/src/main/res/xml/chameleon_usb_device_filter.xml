<!-- This file (which is referenced in the/any main app Manifest file) ensures that the
     running application is notified whenever on of the RevE or RevG boards is plugged in to
     the Android phone over USB. Note that certain USB permissions must also be set in the
     Manifest file for this action to be effective. Actually, per the most intuitive design
     descision the developer could make based on experience with the Chameleon Mini Live
     Debugger application development, a separate activity (ChameleonMiniUSBActivity) must
     also be running in addition to whatever Android activities the Bread Co developers have
     implemented to ensure that these devices are configured correctly on-demand in the
     running activity. In many senses, this design choice is a solid one since it effectively
     encapsulates the running of this library for controlling the Chameleon boards from the
     other core functionality needed in their day-to-day app.
