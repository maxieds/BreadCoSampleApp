# BreadCoSampleApp

## Purpose

This application is a demonstration of how to incorporate the functionality of the
open source [ChameleonMiniUSBInterface library](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniUSBInterface).
This library has been adapted as a standalone interface to the Chameleon Mini RevE (Rebooted) and RevG
devices from the source to the developer's other related
[Chameleon Mini Live Debugger](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger) project.

## Installation

You can install this demo application from source by cloning this repository and building the Java
source code using Android Studio. The procedure for how to go about doing this is outside the
scope of this README. Alternately, you can download a signed binary APK file for the latest
release of this application [here](https://github.com/maxieds/BreadCoSampleApp/releases/latest) and
proceed to test the functionality of the [ChameleonMiniUSBInterface library](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniUSBInterface)
in that way.
